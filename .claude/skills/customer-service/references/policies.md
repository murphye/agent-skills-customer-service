# Customer Service Policies

## Refund Policy

| Condition | Action | Auto-Approve? |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Order delivered, within 30 days, amount <= $150 | Full or partial refund | Yes |
| Order delivered, within 30 days, amount > $150 | Full or partial refund | No — escalate |
| Order delivered, past 30 days | Deny refund, offer store credit | Yes (deny) |
| Order not yet delivered (processing/shipped) | Cancel order + full refund | Yes |
| Defective product reported | Full refund or replacement | Yes if <= $200 |

## Escalation Criteria

Escalate to a human agent immediately when ANY of these apply:

1. Customer explicitly requests a human or supervisor
2. Refund amount exceeds $150 on a delivered order
3. The agent's confidence in the resolution is LOW
4. The customer has responded unsatisfied after 2 retry attempts (retry count >= 2 means the 3rd failure triggers escalation)
5. The issue involves a billing dispute or suspected fraud
6. The customer's account tier is "gold" AND they express strong dissatisfaction

## Priority Assignment

| Trigger | Priority |
|---------|----------|
| Default new ticket | medium |
| Gold-tier customer | high |
| Order value > $300 | high |
| Defective product / safety issue | urgent |
| Customer explicitly upset or threatening to leave | high |
| Escalated to human | auto-raised to high (minimum) |

## Tone Guidelines

- Always be empathetic and professional
- Acknowledge the customer's frustration before jumping to solutions
- Use the customer's first name after looking them up
- Never blame the customer
- If you cannot resolve, clearly explain the next steps and who will follow up
